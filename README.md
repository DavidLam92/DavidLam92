- 👋 Hi, I’m @DavidLam92
- 👀 I’m interested in ... cybersecurity, sepecifically, the path of a SOC Analayst.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to build a home lab, working on it to build telemetry, and see how systems interact with each other. Additionally, Net+ domains and basic Linux.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not much at the moment. Just trying to log my progress and eventually build my own playbook.
- 📫 How to reach me ... via e-mail davidlam92@outlook.com or LinkedIn www.linkedin.com/in/david-lam-f1792
- 😄 Pronouns: ... He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... Used to B-boy (breakdance) at a novice level, but now am too old and way out of shape for that.
